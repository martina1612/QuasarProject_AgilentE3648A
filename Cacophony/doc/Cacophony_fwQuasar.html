    <h1>This is Cacophony, the work-horse of the fwQuasar</h1>
    Written by Piotr P. Nikiel at different moments in 2019<br>
    <h2>A quick intro</h2>
    <p>fwQuasar is a JCOP-style framework to quickly integrate
      quasar-made OPC-UA servers into WinCC OA projects.<br>
      fwQuasar is just a graphical tool but the real work of creating
      DP(T)(E)s, assigning addresses etc. is achieved by Cacophony, of
      which README you are reading now.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Notes<br>
    </h2>
    <h3>Address assignment and address activation<br>
    </h3>
    <p>By a rule of thumb, an OPC-UA peripheral address <b>will always
        be assigned</b> to DPEs per every cache- or source-variable.<br>
      Since the implementation of OPCUA-1457 one can select though which
      addresses will be activated.<br>
      The information shall be passed to invocation of the <i>config
        parser</i> function, i.e. the one of general form
      &lt;prefix&gt;parseConfig as the 5th argument called
      addressActiveControl.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The argument is a mapping; its key matches the quasar class name
      whose activation shall be controlled and the value is a regular
      expression matching variable names.<br>
      No key means that all variables in the class will be activated.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The general guideline to specifying address activation per quasar
      class is the following:<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>if you need all variables to be activated, simply do not
        insert the class name into the mapping</li>
      <li>if you need none of the variables to be activated, insert ""
        (i.e. empty string) per the key</li>
      <li>if you need just one variable to be activated, just put its
        name, e.g. "rawValue"</li>
      <li>if you need few variables, use the alternative symbolised by
        the vertical bar, e.g. "id|state|status|numberOfPackets"</li>
      <li>if you need a more advanced expression, for example a negative
        expression, contact Piotr ;-)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For developers: Cacophony prefixes the given regex with "^" and
      suffixes with "$" so that exact matches are always done.<br>
